## Introduction

RefactorEarth is designed to analyze and improve the efficiency of Python code by identifying memory-intensive operations, redundant computations, and suboptimal data structures. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and sustainability tracking tools like CodeCarbon, RefactorEarth aims to assist developers in writing more sustainable and performant code.

### Project Background

Modern software development, while enabling rapid innovation, often overlooks the sustainability aspect of coding practices. Inefficient code not only slows down performance but also leads to excessive energy consumption, contributing to a larger carbon footprint. This issue is particularly acute in large-scale applications and data centers, where the cumulative impact of inefficient code can result in significant energy wastage.

### Common Issues in Unsustainable Code

1. **Memory-Intensive Operations**: Large, unnecessary memory allocations that strain system resources.
2. **Redundant Computations**: Repeated calculations that could be optimized or cached.
3. **Suboptimal Data Structures**: Use of inefficient data structures that increase processing time and energy consumption.
4. **Inefficient Loops**: Poorly optimized loops that lead to higher CPU utilization and energy consumption.
5. **Inefficient I/O Operations**: Excessive or unoptimized input/output operations that degrade performance.

These inefficiencies not only degrade performance but also significantly increase the energy required to run software applications, making them less sustainable. RefactorEarth aims to address these issues by providing targeted optimizations that reduce the environmental impact of software development.

## Objective

The primary objective of RefactorEarth is to optimize Python code for reduced energy consumption and improved sustainability metrics. This is achieved by analyzing existing codebases and suggesting optimizations that enhance efficiency and reduce the digital carbon footprint.

## Methodology

### Repository Analysis

1. **Clone Target Repository**: Identify and clone the target repository containing Python files.
2. **Initial Metrics Calculation**: Measure initial energy consumption, carbon footprint, and sustainability score using the CodeCarbon tool.

### AI-Powered Refactoring

1. **Base Model**: Utilize Microsoft's CodeBERT as the foundational model.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the model on a custom dataset of energy-efficient Python code.
3. **Optimization Focus**: Emphasize loop efficiency, memory usage, and I/O operations.
4. **Personalization**: Incorporate data from the repository owner's GitHub profile to tailor optimizations.
5. **Iterative Optimization**: Conduct multiple passes to refine and improve code efficiency continuously. The model identifies optimization opportunities by analyzing the code structure, usage patterns, and comparing them with best practices in energy-efficient coding.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs are used to measure the effectiveness of the optimizations:

- **Energy Consumption**: Measured in joules (J) using CodeCarbon.
- **Carbon Footprint**: Measured in grams of CO2 equivalent (gCO2) using CodeCarbon.
- **Sustainability Score**: Scored from 0 to 100.
- **CPU Time**: Measured in seconds.
- **Equivalent Smartphone Charge**: Measured in percentage (%).
- **LED Bulb Power Time**: Measured in seconds for a 10W bulb.

## Sustainability Score Calculation

The Sustainability Score is a composite metric calculated based on energy efficiency and carbon footprint, normalized against predefined maximum values. The formula used is:

\[ \text{Sustainability Score} = (1 - \text{normalized energy consumption}) \times 0.5 + (1 - \text{normalized carbon footprint}) \times 0.5 \]

Where:
- Normalized energy consumption = \(\frac{\text{energy consumption}}{\text{maximum energy consumption}}\)
- Normalized carbon footprint = \(\frac{\text{carbon footprint}}{\text{maximum carbon footprint}}\)

*Note*: The maximum values for normalization are determined based on benchmark datasets and historical data from various projects.
