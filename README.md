# RefactorEarth: AI-Driven Code Optimization for Energy Efficiency

## Objective
Optimize Python code for reduced energy consumption and improved sustainability metrics.

## Methodology
1. Repository Analysis: Clone target repo, identify Python files
2. Initial Metrics Calculation: Energy consumption, carbon footprint, sustainability score
3. AI-Powered Refactoring:
   - Base Model: Microsoft's CodeBERT
   - Fine-tuning: Custom dataset of energy-efficient Python code
   - Optimization Focus: Loop efficiency, memory usage, I/O operations
   - Personalization: Incorporation of repository owner's GitHub data
   - Process: Iterative passes for algorithm and low-level optimizations

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Energy Consumption (joules)
2. Carbon Footprint (gCO2)
3. Sustainability Score (0-100)
4. CPU Time (seconds)
5. Equivalent Smartphone Charge (%)
6. LED Bulb Power Time (seconds, 10W bulb)

## Code Efficiency Metrics
